		<h1>Hey, I'm Houston Golden</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my political activism blog, <a href="/">BuzzGov.com</a></p>
		<p>This week I decided to rebuild BuzzGov in Ruby on Rails because I want a light-weight blog application that can handle a lot of traffic. We are experiencing so much political turmoil in the USA, and this will be a place for me and other writers to vent their frustration with the government on important issues. Maybe we will even make a difference!? We can only try and hope.</p>
		<p>If you'd like to follow along as I post on BuzzGov, find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/houstongolden">@HoustonGolden</a>, or get my posts and exclusive content in your inbox by signing up for my newsletter <a href="htt://eepurl.com/02olT">here</a>.</p>
